# Angularowo
Angularowo is an Android application created for Minecraft "Angularowo" server players.
NOTE: As the server has been closed, this project is currently abandoned.
The app is still available in the Play Store to allow anyone to preview it.

## Features
* Check basic server & user info, e.g. amount of players online, your account balance etc.
* Access online players list and check basic info about them
* View last bans and its details
* Preview in-game chat in realtime
* Receive free bonuses for watching ads

## API
The server has been closed in late 2019. API interface has been programmed to return always the same data to allow anyone to preview the app. Due to project abandonment, the API documentation is not available.
